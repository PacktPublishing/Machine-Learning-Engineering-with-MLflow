########### .dockerignore file for ./docker/jupyter/Dockerfile ###########
# The build context of other services in the docker-compose stack is     #
# their base folder, e.g. "./docker/mlflow/". Therefore their .gitignore #
# files are also there.                                                  #
#                                                                        #
# However, the build context of "./docker/jupyter" is "./", which is why #
# we have the .dockerignore here.                                        #
#                                                                        #
